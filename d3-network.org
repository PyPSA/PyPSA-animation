** export generation data and flows

** Represent directional flows

Either with animation OR with arrow

** Represent generation at each node

https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887235

Pie chart - how to represent load??? red circle under (if gen > load); red circle over (if gen < load)

** Allow different scenarios to be loaded

This will require more work...

** Parallel graph

Either for whole of Europe or individual country

** see per-country time series, total capacity and energy

also per scenario settings

e.g. user from Ireland can see how each country deals with down periods with and without transmission


** tmrow style wind/solar animation?


why doesn't Chrome crash with tmrow.co wind animation??? If not, should be able to deal with network flows
