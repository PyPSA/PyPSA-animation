python -m http.server 8888 &

** Old notes

*** Examples of nice visualisations

**** IWES KWK2

From Fraunhofer IWES for Germany:

http://www.kombikraftwerk.de/kombikraftwerk-2/100-ee-szenario/leistungsflussanimation.html

http://www.kombikraftwerk.de/typo3conf/ext/aee_animation/Resources/Public/JavaScript/animation.js?1402997953

pie charts for RE; load is circle within/out

Line width corresponds to flow (no directionality)

graph above and below line


tech: d3.js and jQuery



**** Greening the Grid India NREL

From NREL for India:

https://maps.nrel.gov/IndiaGTG/

has sun passing over India

dots for each tech

separate graph with moving flow for lines

moving sun over stuff

fills whole screen

tech: jQuery, custom stuff??

**** tmrow.co CO2 map

https://github.com/tmrowco/electricitymap

**** US Electric system operating data

https://www.eia.gov/beta/realtime_grid/#/status?end=20171107T01


**** Lappeenranta LUT

http://www.neocarbonenergy.fi/internetofenergy/#

Has visualisations over time for each region


graph up and down

pie charts and flow


*** Tools for visualisations

**** plotly

do animation over time?

**** bokeh

**** d3js

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12592730/how-to-animate-and-play-over-time-in-d3-js

**** deck.gl

From Uber, uses webGL

https://uber.github.io/deck.gl/#/examples/overview


**** superset

From Airbnb, more of a dashboard

https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset





* TODO

** DONE export generation data and flows

** DONE Represent directional flows

Either with animation OR with arrow

** DONE Represent generation at each node

https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887235

Pie chart - how to represent load??? red circle under (if gen > load); red circle over (if gen < load)

What to do with storage

have pie for BOTH load and generation, storage flipping between the two

** DONE make load transparent?

flipping z-order not supported in SVG, only in CSS

SVG paints in order of SVG

** DONE Legend for generation, storage, load

** DONE Benefits paper first

~/results/supplementary_data_benefits_of_cooperation/results$

https://zenodo.org/record/804338

** DONE Allow different scenarios OR time periods to be loaded

This will require more work...

load_json{
  load_csvs(scenario){
    initial_graphic(){
    }
  }
}


** DONE Play button

https://bl.ocks.org/officeofjane/47d2b0bfeecfcb41d2212d06d095c763

** DONE Area not radius proportional to power

** DONE Zoom, bring down Scandinavia

** DONE Parallel graph

Either for whole of Europe or individual country - drop-down menu to choose

** DONE see per-country time series, total capacity and energy and cost

also per scenario settings

e.g. user from Ireland can see how each country deals with down periods with and without transmission


** tmrow style wind/solar animation?


why doesn't Chrome crash with tmrow.co wind animation??? If not, should be able to deal with network flows

** DONE Make export_network into a library

** DONE Use selection of snapshots rather than num_snapshots

** DONE Load different seasons

** DONE Shrink Natural Earth file?

** DONE Set up github repo pypsa-animation

With AGPL licence, README

Link to and from pypsa.org/animations/pypsa-eur-30/index.html

** Add OCGT marginal, transmission to legend

** Add hover labels to graphs

** DONE Line capacities underneath dashed lines??

** Add comparable websites

** Add BMBF reference?

** //d3js.org/ link

** DONE cosmetics

map graphic bigger

flip power/energy

** screenshot to README

** DONE refactor graph drawing for cost/energy/power

** DONE start in summer

** TODO Other metrics

CO2 price, load-weighted average price, market values of wind and solar

NO! marginal prices not in results files...
